# virtual-battery

This "virtual battery" simulates the behavior and economic impacts of 
            having an electrical storage battery in a building. 
            
It is meant to answer the question:
        
"How much money does the battery owner save over a time period, given a 
specific battery, control algorithm, time-of-use prices policy, and
smart-meter electricity usage set."
     
The simulation can access the necessary data as long as the location of interest
for the virtual battery is within New York State. For electricity pricing
data, the simulation relies on data from NYISO, which only controls prices
within New York State.
